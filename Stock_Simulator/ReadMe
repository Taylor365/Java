This is a Java Stock Market Application that retrieves real-time information from the NASDAQ and outputs the results to the user. The user can enter any stock tick symbol (E.G. GOOG = google, AMZN = Amazon, etc.) and the relevant information will be displayed.

The user can then decide to buy the stock or sell the stock depending on if they own it already. This then corresponds with a back-end mySQL database that keeps track of what stocks where purchased.

The user also starts out with a fake set of funds (â‚¬20,000) that track the profitability of the users trades.
